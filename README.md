INTRODUCTION

Dear CODE-admissions team,

it has now finally become time to present you the results of my challenge!

For my challenge, I have chosen to retackle the website of the student representation that I already had developed last summer.
There were some issues with this website and thus it unfortunately never got published.
The problem that it should have solved has never been solved consequently.
My motivation to choose this as the project for my challenge was therefore to solve the issues that the website that I had developed had
and by that, to hopefully also be able to solve the original problem.

You can read more about my motivation and about how I decided to tackle this project in the file "Documentation/MyMotivation".
All of the questions that you have asked me to answer for you to better understand the process are adressed in there.

Since I wanted to develop a website and because I am mostly interested in software-engineering as a study program,
I mostly coded throughout the challenge.
You can find all of my code in the folders "Front-End" and "Back-End" which contain the code for the user-end (Front-End) and for the admin panel/content management system (Back-End).

Professional software-engineers always plan what they want to do first.
Because I have never done this before and because you wanted me to document my progress, I decided to try this as well. So I, before I started to code, did a full inventory of how the website looked before the challenge. It helped me to get a feeling for what was in place already and helped me to write down want I wanted to achieve during the challenge. After finishing coding I did another inventory of how the website looked now.This helped to look back on what I had achieved and describes what the user can now do with the website and how it has changed in comparison to the website that existed before the challenge.
Both of the inventories are located in the folder "Documentation/inventories".

If you want to check out the before and after practically yourself instead of reading the inventories, please feel free to do so.

The link to the user-end of the website that existed before the challenge is http://ipjtestpage.bplaced.net/GSV-Gemont-Webseite/Front-End/Start.php . From this page you will hopefully get on yourself with the user-end. To access the admin panel that existed before the challenge, go to http://ipjtestpage.bplaced.net/GSV-Gemont-Webseite/Back-End/dashboard.php and login with the credentials "guest"(user) and 1234 as password.

The link to the user-end of the website of after the challenge is http://gsvtestpage.epizy.com/website-repo/Front-End/Start.php . As with the before challenge website, you you will hopefully get on yourself with the user end from the start page  on. To access the new admin panel, go to http://gsvtestpage.epizy.com/website-repo/Back-End/dashboard.php and login with the same credentials.

I have also done a full screen-capture of the result of my challenge that you can watch via this link : https://youtu.be/r1t4tiEkhlo .
It shall give you another impression and overview of what the software that I developed is capable of.


For an even better understanding of the process of development, you can also take a look into the file "WorkDoc" which is located in the Documentation folder as well.
In this file I listed every hour of work that I put in into the project and what I have roughly done in those hours.

Unfortunately I did not commit to github as often as I wanted to so my version control history is not the best or most detailed.
I have used a GitKraken board however which could give you yet another good impression on what I have done during the challenge and what I am still planning to do after the challenge.
To access this GitKraken board just text me an email with the name or email-address of an account that you have there and I will add you as a user of the board as soon as possible.

Since I coded so much, I did not get to comment all of my code thoroughly or correctly.
What I have decided to do instead is to give you a short technical overview of how I build my website. You can find this under Documentation/technicalOverview.
While there are some comments in the code as well, I would not count on them too much.

That was all I got! I hope that you will like it and look forward to hear from you.

To end this, I now just briefly want to say thank you for giving me this awesome challenge.
It has given me a reason to work on a project that I wanted to work on this summer anyways and I enjoyed working on it incredibly much.
Sadly I have, at least in my eyes, not yet been able to fully finish the website. There are still some key features that I either simply forgot to implement or that I just did not have the time for to implement. I am still incredibly proud of my final result and on what I have achieved during the last three weeks and this has only been possible because of you!

Best regards,
Matthias Frey
